  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Driven by the passion for software development and the desire to solve real world problems by technology, I started 
    my studies in computer science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I fastly recognized that constant learning
    and stepping out of the comfort zone is the key to a successful path. That's why I took the opportunity to dive 
    into various topics and companies as a consultant. By that I not only faced different challenges, but also enriched 
    my skill and mindset.
    Some of the crucial topics I learned along the way were 
    * common understanding of coding guidelines and quality, and therefore continuous quality measurement
    * clean code, clean architecture and clean communication
    * agile development as key to stay on the right path
    * recognizing DevOps as a mindset and FullStack as a mindset
    * Domain Driven Design to avoid miscommunication and to align architecture
    
     With backend by heart, architecture by passion and agile by mind I help to solve problems pragmatically.
    
    Btw. what is the hardest challenge in software development to really hit the goal?
    Communication and human interactions!
